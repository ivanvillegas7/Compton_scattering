GitHub repository for the Compton scattering experient.

The letter y or n indicates if the correction has been taken into acount. Without the correction, the computed results are m_e= (-30000±210000) keV/c² and E = (650±100) keV. With the correction, the results are m_e= (400±180) keV/c² and E = (650±100) keV.

With the test data, the results are m_e= (510±60) keV/c² and E = (670±30) keV.
