# Compton scattering
GitHub repository for the Compton scattering experient.

The letter y or n indicates if the correction has been taken into acount. The results are m_e= (430±30) keV/c² and E = (661±4) keV.

With the test data, the results are m_e= (510±60) keV/c² and E = (670±30) keV.

In folder 'Data', the different data files can be found. Running the main code (main.py) from 'Code' folder you can obtain the plots saved in 'Plots'. All the necesassy data and he corresponding results for a test can be found in the folder with the same name. In Folder results, all the obtained results can be seen.
